# API Example

This is a NodeJS REST API example I made to understand the concepts on how to create an API using JavaScript.
I worked on an Angular project _(not available)_ with three different components: Employees, Departments and Tasks

### What to install
In order for this to work, you'll have to install:
```
npm install express

npm install mongoose
```

### Run API
After that, you can run this API through:

```
node index.js
```

### Use API
The url link for this API is http://localhost:3000/ + _{component}_

_{component}_ might be:
- employees
- departments
- tasks

#### PS: all the three components are available to work with GET, DELETE, PUT and POST.
